# M3U-Gen
A custom program to generate playlist files (M3U) with a basic graphical interface. Includes ability to use URLs as well.
This is an improved version of an old Command-Line tool I made.

## How To Use

Boot up the program and input folders / files that you want to be added to your playlist. (WAV / MP3 only)
You are also able to input URLs that directly link to a WAV / MP3 *but* while the program processes these when generating, it will freeze up. (In testing, processing a 30~ min file took 7-10 seconds, depends on internet speed.)
Once you're happy with your playlist, press the generate button and specify the output destination for your M3U file.
